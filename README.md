# COMMENTS ABOUT THIS SCRIPT

The Jupiter notebook SARIMAX for Excel.pynb includes Excel commands like xl() to load the data. In essence you cannot run the scripts directly in your IDE.

If you want to try to execute the commands directly in your IDE, just replace the command xl() to another acceptable command like read.csv() available in pandas.

# REQUIRED INSTALLATIONS IF YOU WANT TO EXECUTE THE SCRIPTS IN YOUR IDE (e.g. VSCode)
To avoid conflicts of installed packages, is strongly recommended you create a virtual environment.

To create the virtual environment, just open your terminal and execute: python -m venv venv

To activate the virtual environment type in your terminal: venv\Scripts\activate

After that install the required packages by typing "pip install -r requirements.txt"
